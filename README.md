MovieBooking

#This is a moviebooking application coded mainly in Python with the help of the tkinter module.
#It uses the MySQL software as its database.

The basic way to install and use this application would be to copy the .py file and then paste it in your programming platform
Then you would be required to use the MySQL Workbench to create the database.
You will then need to get the rootserver name and password from the Workbench app and make the necessary changes in the python program.
Once this is done the application should run smoothly

You are now good to go.
